# Homestuck POV Cam

The POV Cam is a Chrome extension (found in the Chrome store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/homestuck-pov-cam/amojmegbfaaookabgifgaiblfdlgapoj)), which modifies the links of Homestuck so that one may follow the events from the point of view of a single character.

### Structure

The extension itself is contained within the folder "POV Cam".

A human readable form of the timeline data (with annotations) can be found in the "Readable Timelines" folder.

The Python script in root is used to create the "POV Cam/timelines.js" file from the readable timelines, and also the javascript files in root.
